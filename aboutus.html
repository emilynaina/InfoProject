          <h2>Internships Shouldn’t Be This Hard</h2>
          <p>
            Endless scrolling. Vague job descriptions. Application black holes. <strong>We've all been there  </strong>— 
            feeling stuck in a loop of stress and confusion just trying to land a meaningful internship. 
            Whether you're looking for experience in finance, tech, or creative fields, the process can 
            feel like a full-time job with no guarantee of success.

            <strong>personalized matching</strong> to help you succeed at every stage.

            Our intuitive dashboard is more than a list of jobs. You can toggle between 
            <strong>All Jobs</strong> and <strong>Favorites</strong>, search specific titles, 
            and instantly see key info like   <strong>location, pay, </strong>and <strong>duration!</strong>
            No more mystery. No more spam. Just opportunities that match your goals.
